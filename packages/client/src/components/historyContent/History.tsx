          Alice felt the life drain out of her body as she took her final breath.
          Darkness engulfed her, and she felt as though she were falling into a bottomless pit.
          Suddenly, she felt a jolt, and her eyes snapped open. She found herself in a new world, surrounded by strange, fantastical creatures.

          Alice smiled, ready to embrace this new world and all its wonders.
