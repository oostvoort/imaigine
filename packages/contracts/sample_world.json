      "name": "The Outskirts of Therun",
      "description": "The Outskirts of Therun is a settlement located in the north-western continent of Velvetria, situated in a sprawling forest biome. The outpost serves as a refuge for weary travelers, offering shelter and goods from all over the realm. Therun has been around for centuries, though its population size has fluctuated from time to time. In its current incarnation, the settlement is relatively small but well defended, with a strong militia of local elves and humans going ever vigilant on its borders. The wealthy merchant families who inhabit the settlement have a fairly high standard of living, particularly compared to the rest of Velvetria, and are known for their generous hospitality and abundant resources. Though the safety of the area is relatively high, bold adventurers are still warned to be wary of the Demon King's forces that lurk in the shadows. Overall, the Outskirts of Therun is a vibrant place with a deep history and a promising future.",
